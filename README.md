# istio-fortsa

An SRE's dream: Keep Istio's data-plane up-to-date without toil.

## Name

The name comes from the Greek phrase "Όρτσα τα πανιά!" meaning roughly "Full Sail Ahead"

## Description

When updating Istio, one particular task is pretty much impossible to do with a GitOps-style
workflow: Restarting all the pods running the previous versions of Istio's sidecar proxy. This
is an onerous task even when doing everything via scripts or using something like Ansible. It
can take hours - or even longer - and it's easy to make mistakes. An that's just for a single
medium-sized cluster. If you have many clusters, keeping Istio's data-plane up-to-date can be
a full-time job!

This project is a Kubernetes Operator that automates away the whole task, as much as possible.

In the spirit of being as simple as possible, there are currently no CRDs and no dependencies
other than running in a cluster that uses Istio. Note that we've only tested this when using
Istio's default envoy-based proxy.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by my experience with the toil of keeping the istio data-plane
up-to-date and then discovering the solution Google had come up with, described in this
YouTube video: https://youtu.be/R86ZsYH7Ka4

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster running Istio (lowest version not yet determined)

### To Deploy on the cluster

This project is packaged for deployment using Helm or OLM. See the "Packages" for the
various docker images available. The helm repo is here:

```
https://hercynium.github.io/istio-fortsa/
```

Installation should be like any other app packeged for Helm or OLM depending on the
method you want to use.

## Project Distribution

When a release is published, the project uses a Github Action to build several artifacts,
including Docker images of the Operator application, OLM bundle, OLM catalog, and the Helm
chart. The helm chart tarball is also attached to the release alongside the source code
archives.

Because this project was created using the operator-sdk, which itself is a wrapper around
kubebuilder, please look at the documentation for those frameworks for more info about
build, test, distribution, and deployment details.

## TODO

There's lots to do! If you want to help, see the Contributing section, below.

## Contributing

This is a young project and we can use all the help we can get! Feature requests, bug
reports, patches, documentation, testing, CI/CD, helm charts, you name it!

**NOTE:** Run `make help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
